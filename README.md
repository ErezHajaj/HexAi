This is a project to play game of HEX https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)


There are multiple versions that I used to play against each other to test the effectiveness of different changes.

The version that was most successful is "FINAL VERSION"


This project was practice for making AIs to play boardgames, while it worked effectively, there are many things I would have done differently in hindsight:

- Better organization (instead of everything in one file)
- Kept variables for different approaches in a file, so that they can be tested seperately.
